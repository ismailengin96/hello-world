# hello-world
Just another repository



Hi everyone,

Ä°smail here. I've recently started my first year at collage. I'm studying Software Engineering. I'm currently using and learning C# language. We are currently making some console applications. I'm so hyped for this github thing.
So I hope i can understand the environment of it and start using.
